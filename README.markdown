This is very much a work in progress.

The idea is to generate (and run) tournaments. The erlang stuff is just for prototyping, I expect all the code to be JS by the end.

All it does now is generate an empty tournament bracket using Raphael js.

There is some basic poc erlang code but the hard stuff (non pow 2 tournaments) is still to be done. As is putting it all together. It is onlt on github so I don't lose the code and only public 'cos I've not got any private repos left :)
